# PROJECT-1.-HeadHunter
# Job Market Analysis (Russia, HeadHunter.ru)

## About this project  
This project was completed as part of a data science bootcamp in Russia. The goal was to analyze job postings from the HeadHunter.ru platform to understand trends in salaries, job categories, and skills in demand.

## Data  
The data was collected via the HeadHunter API and represents job postings in Russia, specifically in Moscow. It includes job titles, salaries, descriptions, and other metadata.

## Objectives  
- Analyze salary distributions and job types  
- Identify top skills required for Data Science roles  
- Explore keyword frequencies using text mining and TF-IDF

## Tools used  
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- `wordcloud`, `nltk`, `sklearn`  
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

## Key insights  
- Data Science-related job titles show wide salary variation  
- Certain keywords (e.g. "Python", "SQL") appear frequently in postings  
- TF-IDF revealed specific terms associated with high-paying positions

##  Note  
The code and comments are in Russian, as this was part of a Russian-language bootcamp. However, the structure and visualizations are self-explanatory, and key insights are described in this README.
